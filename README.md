# Random-Stuffs
This folder consist of me doing some hobby in coding, f/g are description of what the above file does:
1)  The file "26_10conv.py" is used to convert a decimal number to base 26 (A-Z) number system and vice-versa.
2) "Deci_decoder.py" file was written to decode the binary unicode (ASCII) separated by a white space to human readable form.
3) One of the popular yet a best way to describe the recursive property of computation "Fibonacci.py".
4) Natural Numbers has a certain mathematical structure that upon doing x -> 3x+1 or x -> x/2 (if even) always end up being in 1, but after how many iteration does it converge? It's what a Chaos property of Natural number is, the file "chaos.py" does the simple analysis to some number.
